            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-5">Privacy Statement</h6>
            <p>
                At SOFTSHIRT, protecting your privacy is our priority. We are dedicated to safeguarding the personal
                information of our customers, employees, suppliers, and business associates. This includes any data that can
                identify a specific person. We only collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us through
                our website, ensuring we offer the information and services you request. To maintain trust and comply with
                the law, we have established privacy policies and data protection procedures for all processes and services
                involving the collection, processing, storage, and handling of personal information.
            </p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Commitment, Choice and Consent</h6>
            <p>
                We value your privacy and give you control over your personal information. We will only collect and use your
                personal information if you consent to it or if it's necessary under a lawful contract. We believe in giving
                individuals choices about how their personal information is used, especially when it comes to
                employment-related services and events. If we need to use your personal information for specific purposes,
                we will ask for your permission, and you'll have the option to agree or decline. Your choices and consent
                matter to us.
            </p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Collection, Use and Retention of Personal Information</h6>
            <p>When you provide your personal information on SOFTSHIRT's system, application, or website, you agree that we
                can use it as described in our Privacy Statement. We won't use your information for other purposes unless
                you give us explicit permission or if it's required or allowed by law or professional standards. For
                instance, if you place a software product order request, we'll use your personal information to respond to
                and process your request.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Cookies</h6>
            <p>When you visit a website, it may store some information on your computer called a cookie. This cookie helps
                the website remember you when you return. At SOFTSHIRT, we use cookies to track visitors, see how they use
                our website, and understand their preferences. If you don't want cookies on your computer, you can change
                your browser settings to refuse them. Just keep in mind that some features on our website may not work
                properly without cookies.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Ads</h6>
            <p>Some ads you see on our websites are delivered by advertising partners who may use cookies. These cookies
                help the ad server recognize your computer and gather information about you and others who use your
                computer. This data helps ad networks show you targeted ads they think you'll find interesting. Remember,
                our Privacy Policy only applies to cookies used by SOFTSHIRT, not any third-party cookies.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Access</h6>
            <p>Access: If you've shared your personal information with SOFTSHIRT, you have the right to access it and
                correct any mistakes. If you want to update or remove your information, just contact us at
                info@softshirt.in. We'll do our best to fulfill your request, as long as it aligns with the law and
                professional standards.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Security for Personal Data</h6>
            <p>We take your data's security seriously. We use industry-standard measures to protect your Personal
                Information. It is stored in a controlled facility to prevent unauthorized physical access. Only those
                within SOFTSHIRT who have a business need can access your Personal Information in electronic databases.
                While we do our best to ensure security, it's essential to know that complete risk elimination is not
                possible.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Disclosure to third parties and onward transfer</h6>
            <p>We prioritize your privacy. We don't share your personal information with unaffiliated third parties, except
                when necessary for legitimate business needs, fulfilling requests, or as required by law. Sometimes, we may
                share your information with outside companies or service providers working on our behalf.</p>
            <p>In some cases, we might transfer your personal information to other SOFTSHIRT entities, subsidiaries, or
                outside companies, even across borders. By providing your information on our website, you agree to this
                transfer and storage. We may also disclose your information in connection with the sale of our business, in
                response to government or law enforcement requests, or to meet legal requirements.</p>
            <p>Rest assured, we don't sell your personal information to third parties, and we won't transfer it for their
                direct marketing purposes.</p>
            <p>When third parties process your information on our behalf, we ensure they follow strict instructions and
                security measures similar to ours. All transfers are done under lawful agreements and with your consent for
                specific purposes. We make sure third parties implement strong security and privacy controls, equivalent to
                or better than our own.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Revision and Updates to the Privacy Policy</h6>
            <p>We may update our Privacy Statement from time to time to match our current privacy policies. When we make
                changes, we'll show the "updated" date on the same page. We recommend checking this Privacy Statement
                occasionally to stay informed about how we protect your information. If you keep using our website, it means
                you agree to the updates we've made.</p>
            <h6 class="title mb-0 mt-3">Monitoring and Feedback</h6>
            <p>We always keep an eye on the laws in the country where we operate to make sure we're following all the rules.
                If there are any changes, we'll update our Privacy Policy accordingly.</p>
            <p>If you have any privacy-related concerns, complaints, disputes, or questions about how we handle personal
                information, please get in touch with our privacy executive at info@softshirt.in. You can also use this
                address to share any concerns you have about our Privacy Policies. We're here to listen and help!</p>
